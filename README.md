# DBM1
This is the repository used to organized and build our DBM1: Databases and Data Mining project as part of Riccardo Tommassini's class at INSA Lyon. 

We retrieved the underlying dataset of our project from kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/shivagovindasamy/2020-tokyo-paralympics

It contains information on the 2020 Tokyo Paralympics. More specifically, an abundant amount of data on athletes, coaches, sports, events, etc is present.
